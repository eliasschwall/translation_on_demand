# Translation on Demand Project

We define ToD as an increase in protein abundance due to enhanced translation, occurring without any change in the mRNA levels or an increase in protein levels that cannot be solely attributed to increased transcription of the corresponding gene. In other words, ToD is a regulatory mechanism where translation efficiency is selectively increased for specific genes. This upregulation allows for rapid adjustments in protein levels, supporting cellular responses that need immediate protein synthesis without requiring new mRNA transcription. Such translation driven increases could be particularly useful in situations where quick adaptations are necessary, as it enables cells to respond to changes in the environment or developmental cues by rapidly elevating the protein output from existing mRNA pools.
